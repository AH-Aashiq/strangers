# Title

Write a program to Find the Roots of a Quadratic Equation

## Description

The standard form of a quadratic equation is:

ax2 + bx + c = 0, where

a, b and c are real numbers and

a != 0

The term b2; - 4ac is known as the discriminant of a quadratic equation. It tells the nature of the roots.

- Logic

  - If the discriminant is greater than 0, the roots are real and different.
  - If the discriminant is equal to 0, the roots are real and equal.
  - If the discriminant is less than 0, the roots are complex and different.
