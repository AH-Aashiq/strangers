## Description

Write a program to check whether the triangle is valid or not if sides are given

- Logic

  - A triangle is valid if the sum of its two sides is greater than the third side.
  - Letâ€™s say that a, b, c is the sides of the triangle. So it must satisfy the below criteria :
    - a + b > c
    - a + c > b
    - b + c > a

- Test Cases

| Input                         | Output         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| Enter 1 side of triangle: = 3 |                |
| Enter 2 side of triangle: = 2 | Valid Triangle |
| Enter 3 side of triangle: = 4 |                |
