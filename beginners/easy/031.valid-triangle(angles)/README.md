## Description

Write a program to check whether the triangle is valid or not if angles are given.

- Logic

  - The angle property of the triangle says that the sum of all three angles should be equal to 180.
  - Get three angles of triangle from the user
  - Calculate sum of angles
  - Check sum of three angles

- Test Cases

| Input                            | Output         |
| -------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Enter 1 angles of triangle: = 45 |                |
| Enter 2 angles of triangle: = 90 | Valid Triangle |
| Enter 3 angles of triangle: = 45 |                |
