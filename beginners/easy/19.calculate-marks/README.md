# Calculate the total, percentage and division to take marks of three subjects 

##  You need to take 3 input from a student. Roll, Name and marks of 3 subjects(Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science) he/she got in his/her exam. Calculate total marks, parcentage and division of a student.

- Input
	- 1st input will be student roll number
	- 2nd input will be student Name
	- 3rd input will be the marks on physics, chemistry and computer science

- Output
	- 1st line print the roll number
	- 2nd line print the name
	- 3rd line print the marks of Physics
	- 4th line print the marks of Chemistry
	- 5th line print the marks of Computer Science
	- 6th line print total marks of these subjects
	- 7th line calculate the percentage of those marks and print it
	- 8th line calculate the division
		- if parcentage marks greater or equal 60 then it will be First division
		- if parcentage marks less then 60 and greater and equal 48 then it will be Second division
		- if parcentage marks less then 48 and greater and equal 36 then it will be Third division
