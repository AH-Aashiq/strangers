# Watermelon

## Description

Your friend has M watermelons. He doesn't want to share them with anyone, but let's imagine he would.

He needs to distribute them equally among K people. Given he shares them whole and gives them as many as possible, print how many watermelons would remain after giving every individual an equal number of watermelons.

You can assume that there will be more watermelons than the number of people.

- Input
  The input will contain two integers: M (K < M < 1000000K<M<1000000) and K (0 < K < 1000<K<100).

- Output
  Print the number of remaining watermelons.
